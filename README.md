# Hii, I'm Dhruv
founding Engineer at Shapes Inc.
Right now, I'm pursuing a BS - DS(remote) @ IIT Madras.

I'm into a lot of things - cool software and gaming top the list.
I've been building cool tech(lol) for a while now.
Not everything needs to scale, some things are just fun to make.
Sometimes I'm designing, sometimes I'm asking cursor to bring them to life - no joke,
but mostly I just want the product to feel good.
