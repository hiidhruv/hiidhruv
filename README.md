# Hii, I'm Dhruv
founding Engineer at Shapes Inc.
Right now, I'm pursuing a CS degree at some university.

I'm into a lot of things - cool software and gaming top the list.
I've been building cool tech(lol) for a while now.
Not everything needs to scale, some things are just fun to make.
Sometimes I'm designing, sometimes I'm asking cursor tp bring them to life - no joke,
but mostly I just want the product to feel good.
